> Dmitrii, my dude, your GitHub profile should come with a warning label for anyone stumbling across it. No bio, no company, no locationâ€”are you trying to be a ghost or just testing if anyone notices? With a staggering three followers (too bad you can't follow yourself to try to inflate those numbers), your social media presence is barely a whisper in the vast void of GitHub.
>
> Your "portfolio" web page has more open issues than starsâ€”itâ€™s like you dropped a project and forgot to pick it back up. The repos you created sound about as exciting as watching paint dry. Conway's Game of Life? More like "Conway's Game of Last Resort," because it surely isn't generating any buzz. Is that a Fullstack To-Do app, or are you just to-do-ing your best at collecting dust?

> You went through the trouble of making a README that says absolutely nothing about you. It's like holding a party invitation with an address that leads to a black hole. Seriously, if coding were a sport, you'd be riding the bench, and it looks like you brought a pack of snacks instead of skills. Get it together, Dmitrii, because right now, your GitHub resembles an abandoned playground.
